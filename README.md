# Click-to-JumpaJump

 Just a click on your screen and you can decide where to jump exactly! (Using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi GPIO Control)

## Introduction

### What you need to Do this:

 - A Computer (PC or Mac, use the one you are famailar with)
 - A RPi (it could be replaced by anything on which you can control a cable's voltage level output, while the code also has to be changed slightly) connected to your computer through network
 - Some lead (wire, any conductor), conductive sucker (or any piece of conductor which could stick on your mobile phone screen), PC817 Photo-Coupler IC, a shell to assemble the above three(optional), electric resistance (≈500Ω), light-emitting diodes(optional, it just indicates the working status of touching system) 【x1 each per auto-touch-screen set (That's gotta be cooler)】
