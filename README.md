# Click-to-JumpaJump

 Just a click on your screen and you can decide where to jump exactly!

## This branch contains the source code (including code for test and deployment) which deploys on RPi side.

(Actually RPi could be replaced by anything on which you can control a cable's voltage level output, while the code also has to be changed slightly)

Configure your ip address, then run main.py, and the control client on your Personal Computer would receive the camera view strem.
